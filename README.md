# Python Basics/Concepts

Welcome to the new Repo for my Python projects. I originally had a Concepts folder located in the RPG World Repo. But I didn't want
to keep clutter my workspace with constant updates to the Concepts folder. So whenever I finish a Lesson I'll update it here.

## Current Goal
- Finish 1.4 Python List [WIP]
- Finish 1.5 Checkpoint (Test) [Not Started] -
- This is a test in which I incorperate everything I learn to create a Grocery List or Menu where
  the user has a budget and the user chooses what every they want within the budget.

## Changelog

7/3/2023
- Added  Unit 1 Hello World (Basics) [Section 1.1 - 1.3]
- Added a new release for said Sections.
